# Amazon e-commerce UI clone

What began as a front-end project to practice working with APIs has snowballed into a full stack emulation of Amazon's e-commerce site.

## Tech Stack

This project consists of a React JS front end with Styled Component CSS, React Router & Axios. The back-end for this project is in another respository. For product data, I am working with the products API provided by dummyjson.com.

### Features

I conveived of this project as a portfolio piece to simulate the entire process of online retail. The site works for both guest users who can access all UI features and authenticated users who can access the account section and manage addresses, payment methods and more. Features include:

• User authentication with JWT
• Add, edit and delete addresses with controls for adding default status
• Add and remove fake payment methods (a fake bank card can be created by choosing from a few options)
• Browse products, add to basket, edit quantities and remove from basket
• Select shipping details
• Generate orders and manage them from the Orders page
• Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop
• And much more!

### Purpose

I am particularly interested in UI design and front end development so this was an excellent way to practice reproducing pixel perfect layout designs and practice the development of a range of front end related challenges. Where possible, I have tried to faithfully reproduce the appearance and behaviour of the real Amazon site to the best of my ability. 

### Disclaimer

All brand imagery and promo imagery used throughout the site is property of Amazon and this project was created purely for educational purposes as a way to practice full stack engineering principles and UI design.
